# Detecting Persuasion Techniques in Memes

## Project Description

"Detecting Persuasion Techniques in Memes" is a research project aimed at identifying and analyzing various persuasion techniques used in memes. This project is part of the SemEval2024
shared task on "Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes." The challenge involves understanding and classifying the persuasive elements in memes, which may include logical 
fallacies and emotional appeals, among others.

Memes are a potent medium in online discourse, often used in disinformation campaigns. By combining text and imagery, they can effectively influence public opinion. 
This project seeks to detect these techniques through hierarchical multilabel classification tasks, analyzing both the textual and visual components of memes. 

The tasks are divided into:
- **Subtask 1:** Identification of persuasion techniques from the textual content alone.
- **Subtask 2a:** Multimodal analysis, identifying persuasion techniques from both text and image.

This repository contains the code, models developed for the SemEval2024 competition, providing tools to tackle the challenges of detecting persuasion in multimodal content.
